    <h1>Player's Ball - OutKast</h1>
    <h4>Verse 1</h4>
    <p>It's beginnin' to look a lot like what?<br>
Follow my every step take notes<br>
On how I creep I's bout ta go in deep<br>
This is the way I creep my season<br>
Here's my ghetto rep I kept to say<br>
The least no no it can't cease so I<br>
Begin to piece my two and two together<br>
Gots no snowy weather have to<br>
Find something to do better bet!<br>
I said subtract so shut up that<br>
Nonsense about some solid nine I got say<br>
Crock if it ain't real it<br>
Ain't right I'm like no matter what the season<br>
Forever chill with spin I get my fin I chill with less<br>
And got my reasons so tell me what did you expect?<br>
You thought I'd break my neck to help y'all deck the halls oh<br>
Now I got 'nother means of celebratin' I'm gettin' biz to that ho-jo I<br>
Gots the hoochie waitin' I made it through<br>
To another year can't ask fo' much mo it's Outkast<br>
For the boots I thought you knew so now you know<br>
Let's go</p>
